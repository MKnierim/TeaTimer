**Next steps**
	- Figure out how to integrate user input into program logic well (in teaMenu()) - See the book chapter on smart live modeless dialogs


**Deployment**
	- Figure out how to pack & deploy so that people can use it without having to install PyQt
    	+ Currently this seems problematic using PyInstaller (stackoverflow post has been initiated)
    	+ If this does not get solved, consider switching to cx_Freeze
    	+ I could try PyInstaller again now that I have reinstalled Python and PyQt with Homebrew...
